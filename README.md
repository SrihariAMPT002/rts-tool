Recruitment Tracking System

The RTS Tool is a recruitment management system designed to streamline and optimize the process of tracking and storing candidate data, specifically focusing on disability candidates. The tool replaces the existing practice of storing candidate information in Excel sheets by providing a centralized, secure, and scalable platform for handling recruitment data. 

The RTS Tool is intended for organizations like Ampera, which sources candidates for client companies, including both technical and non-technical profiles. The tool helps to: 

Collect and securely store detailed candidate information, including skills, education, contact details, experience, salary expectations, and more. 

Manage the interview process, including tracking stages, interview outcomes, and scheduling. 

Track and filter candidates based on various criteria, including disabilities, to ensure diversity and inclusivity. 

Provide secure access to client companies, ensuring that sensitive data, especially related to candidates' disabilities, is stored and handled with confidentiality and compliance. 

The RTS Tool's primary goal is to create a more efficient, organized, and secure process for recruiting candidates, with particular attention given to candidates with disabilities. This includes ensuring that their data is handled in a way that respects privacy, meets legal requirements, and provides an inclusive approach to recruitment.
